# Radar
Simple radar made with arduino and c#. Nothing more nothing less. Watch my youtube video for more info. Unfortunately I didn't write documentation. I am too lazy. And also the quality of code is't too good. I was in hurry when I write it :D so I hope it will help you at least little bit. If you want just run program go to app/radar/bin/realeas/radar.exe
